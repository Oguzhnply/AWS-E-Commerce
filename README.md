CloudFront retrieves static content from an S3 bucket and dynamic content from an Application Load Balancer positioned in front of the web instances.

An Amazon Aurora MySQL instance hosts the WordPress database. The WordPress EC2 instances access shared WordPress data on an Amazon EFS file system through an EFS Mount Target located in each Availability Zone. An Internet Gateway facilitates communication between your VPC resources and the internet, while NAT Gateways in each Availability Zone enable EC2 instances in private subnets (App and Data) to access the internet. Additionally, a VPN connection is established to securely link on-premises resources to the VPC
